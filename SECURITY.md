## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue in DICOM Fuzzer, please report it responsibly.

### Reporting Process

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **DO** email security reports to: [security contact email - placeholder]
3. Include the following information in your report:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Affected versions
   - Potential impact
   - Proof-of-concept (if available)
   - Suggested remediation (if known)

### What to Expect

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days with assessment and timeline
- **Resolution Timeline**: Varies by severity (see below)
- **Public Disclosure**: Coordinated with reporter after fix is released

### Severity Levels and Response Times

| Severity     | Response Time | Fix Timeline | Examples                                     |

## Security Considerations for Users

### General Security

DICOM Fuzzer is a **security testing tool** designed for authorized penetration testing and security research. Users must:

1. **Authorization Required**: Only test systems you own or have explicit permission to test
2. **Legal Compliance**: Comply with all applicable laws and regulations (CFAA, GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
3. **Responsible Disclosure**: Report discovered vulnerabilities responsibly
4. **Ethical Use**: Use the tool for defensive security, not malicious purposes

### Protected Health Information (PHI)

DICOM files often contain Protected Health Information (PHI). When using DICOM Fuzzer:

1. **Never Use Production Data**: Do not fuzz production DICOM files containing real patient data
2. **Anonymize Test Data**: Use anonymized or synthetic DICOM files for testing
3. **Secure Storage**: Store fuzzed files in secure, access-controlled locations
4. **Proper Disposal**: Securely delete fuzzed files after testing
5. **Logging**: Be aware that PHI may appear in logs if production data is used (NOT recommended)

### Network Security

When performing network fuzzing:

1. **Isolated Networks**: Use isolated test networks, not production medical networks
2. **Firewall Rules**: Implement proper firewall rules to prevent unintended exposure
3. **Authentication**: Use strong authentication for DICOM network services
4. **Encryption**: Enable TLS for DICOM network communications where supported
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor network traffic for anomalies during fuzzing

### File Security

Fuzzed DICOM files may trigger vulnerabilities:

1. **Sandboxing**: Open fuzzed files in sandboxed environments
2. **Virtualization**: Use virtual machines or containers for testing
3. **Antivirus**: Be aware that antivirus may quarantine fuzzed files (false positives)
4. **Backups**: Maintain backups of test systems before fuzzing
5. **Integrity Checks**: Verify system integrity after fuzzing campaigns

## Security Features

DICOM Fuzzer includes built-in security features:

### Input Validation

- **File Size Limits**: Default 100MB limit (configurable)
- **Path Validation**: Prevents directory traversal attacks
- **DICOM Structure Validation**: Validates DICOM file structure

### Attack Detection

- **Null Byte Injection**: Detects null bytes in string fields
- **Buffer Overflow Detection**: Identifies oversized values (>10KB)
- **DoS Pattern Detection**:
  - Excessive element count (>10,000)
  - Deeply nested sequences (>10 levels)
  - Excessive private tags (>100)
  - Large private data (>1MB)

### Data Protection

- **PHI Redaction**: Automatic PHI redaction in logs (PatientName, PatientID, etc.)
- **Sensitive Data Masking**: Masks sensitive information in output
- **Security Event Logging**: Tracks security-relevant events

### Safe Defaults

- **Security-Conscious Configuration**: Secure defaults out of the box
- **Strict Validation Modes**: Optional strict validation for enhanced security
- **Isolated Testing Environments**: Encourages sandboxed testing

## Known Security Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Log Sanitization**: PHI redaction is best-effort; avoid using production data
2. **Memory Safety**: Python memory management may leak data in memory
3. **Crash Analysis**: Crash dumps may contain sensitive information
4. **Network Fuzzing**: May cause denial-of-service on target systems

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Use Synthetic Data**: Generate synthetic DICOM files for testing
2. **Secure Logging**: Store logs in access-controlled directories
3. **Memory Wiping**: Consider memory wiping for highly sensitive environments
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for network fuzzing

## Secure Development Practices

DICOM Fuzzer follows secure development practices:

### Code Quality

- **Linting**: Ruff linter with security rules enabled
- **Type Checking**: mypy for static type checking
- **Security Scanning**: Bandit for security vulnerability detection
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular dependency vulnerability checks

### Testing

- **Security Tests**: Dedicated security test suite
- **Attack Vector Validation**: Tests for common attack patterns
- **PHI Redaction Tests**: Verifies PHI redaction functionality
- **Fuzzing Tests**: Fuzz-tests critical components

### Code Review

- **Pull Request Reviews**: All changes reviewed before merge
- **Security Review**: Security-focused review for sensitive components
- **Automated Checks**: CI/CD pipeline enforces code quality
