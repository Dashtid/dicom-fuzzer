## Coverage by Module

### Excellent Coverage (90-100%)
| Module | Coverage | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| `core/__init__.py` | 100% | ✅ Complete |
| `core/config.py` | 100% | ✅ Complete |
| `core/types.py` | 100% | ✅ Complete |
| `core/corpus.py` | 91% | ✅ Excellent |

### Good Coverage (40-89%)
| Module | Coverage | Missing Areas |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| `core/exceptions.py` | 79% | Custom exception handling (lines 28-31) |
| `core/coverage_fuzzer.py` | 48% | Integration workflow, reporting (179-457) |
| `core/mutator.py` | 46% | Complex mutation strategies (186-471) |
| `core/coverage_tracker.py` | 44% | Coverage analysis, aggregation (53-353) |

### Needs Improvement (0-39%)
| Module | Coverage | Priority | Missing Areas |
|--------|----------|----------|---------------|
| `core/profiler.py` | 35% | Medium | Performance analysis functions |
| `core/crash_analyzer.py` | 33% | High | Crash triaging, analysis (111-408) |
| `core/target_runner.py` | 31% | High | External process execution (97-303) |
| `core/fuzzing_session.py` | 30% | **Critical** | Session tracking, artifact preservation |
| `core/statistics.py` | 29% | Medium | Statistical reporting |
| `core/generator.py` | 27% | Medium | Test case generation |
| `core/crash_deduplication.py` | 24% | **Critical** | Deduplication algorithms |
| `core/parser.py` | 20% | Low | DICOM parsing utilities |
| `core/reporter.py` | 19% | Medium | Report generation |
| `core/mutation_minimization.py` | 18% | **Critical** | Delta debugging, minimization |
| `core/validator.py` | 17% | Low | DICOM validation |
| `core/grammar_fuzzer.py` | 13% | Low | Grammar-based fuzzing |

### No Coverage (0%)
| Module | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| `core/enhanced_reporter.py` | Newly added, needs integration tests |
| `core/coverage_correlation.py` | Newly added, needs integration tests |
| `examples/demo_dictionary_fuzzing.py` | Example script (not tested) |
| `examples/demo_fuzzing.py` | Example script (not tested) |
| `examples/fuzz_dicom_viewer.py` | Integration script (needs E2E tests) |

## Critical Gaps to Address

### Priority 1 - Newly Added Features (0-30% coverage)
These are the advanced features just implemented:
1. **`core/fuzzing_session.py`** (30%) - Session tracking needs integration tests
2. **`core/crash_deduplication.py`** (24%) - Algorithm tests exist but integration missing
3. **`core/mutation_minimization.py`** (18%) - Algorithm tests exist but integration missing
4. **`core/enhanced_reporter.py`** (0%) - No tests yet, needs HTML generation tests
5. **`core/coverage_correlation.py`** (0%) - No tests yet, needs analysis tests

### Priority 2 - Core Functionality (31-46%)
Integration and workflow tests needed:
1. **`core/target_runner.py`** (31%) - External process execution not fully tested
2. **`core/crash_analyzer.py`** (33%) - Crash analysis workflows need tests
3. **`core/coverage_tracker.py`** (44%) - Coverage aggregation needs tests
4. **`core/mutator.py`** (46%) - Complex mutation strategies need more tests

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix flaky test** in `test_mutator.py` by setting deterministic mutation probability
2. **Add integration tests** for the new reporting system:
   - Test full fuzzing workflow with `FuzzingSession`
   - Test crash deduplication with real crash data
   - Test mutation minimization end-to-end
   - Test HTML report generation
   - Test coverage correlation

### Short-term Goals
1. Bring critical new features to >80% coverage
2. Fix the 1 flaky test
3. Add integration tests for `target_runner.py` and `crash_analyzer.py`

### Long-term Goals
1. Achieve 95% overall coverage target
2. Add end-to-end tests for example scripts
3. Add performance regression tests

## Test Execution Details

```bash
# Run full test suite
.venv/Scripts/python -m pytest tests/ -v --cov=core --cov=examples

# Run with HTML coverage report
.venv/Scripts/python -m pytest tests/ --cov=core --cov-report=html

# View coverage report
start reports/coverage/htmlcov/index.html  # Windows
```

## Notes

- **Unit tests**: 802 tests covering individual functions/classes
- **Integration tests needed**: Full workflow tests for fuzzing sessions
- **Example scripts**: Not tested (by design - they're demonstrations)
- **Warnings**: 1481 pydicom warnings (expected from fuzzing operations)
