# Fuzzing Session Notes - October 23, 2025

## Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Focus**: Real-world 3D DICOM fuzzing with production viewer application
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Status**: Initial testing complete, comprehensive roadmap created

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Current Fuzzer Behavior with 3D Datasets

**Observation**: The fuzzer currently operates on **individual 2D DICOM slices**, not complete 3D series.

**Test Dataset Structure**:

- 3D CT volume: 130 individual DICOM files (512x512 pixels each, ~514 KB per file)
- Total series size: ~66 MB
- Storage format: Multi-slice series (one file per slice)
- Each slice has same `SeriesInstanceUID` to group them as 3D volume

**Fuzzer Behavior**:

- ✅ Successfully loaded and mutated individual slices
- ✅ Applied intelligent mutations (SQL injection, XSS, type confusion, invalid UIDs)
- ✅ Generated fuzzed output files
- ❌ Treated each slice independently (no awareness of 3D relationships)
- ❌ No series-level mutations (slice position, orientation, spacing)

### 2. Viewer Application Testing

**Discovery**: DICOM viewer supports command-line folder loading:

```
viewer.exe "C:/path/to/series/folder"
```

This enables automated testing of 3D series (not just individual files).

**Test Results**:

**Individual Fuzzed Files** (Initial Test):

- Processed: 10 DICOM files from series
- Fuzzed: 10 files (with 3 mutations each)
- Generated: 2 valid fuzzed files (8 failed to serialize due to extreme corruption)
- Hangs: 2/2 tested files (100% hang rate!)

**Fuzzed 3D Series** (Follow-up Test):

- Created test series: 130 slices (129 clean + 1 fuzzed)
- Result: Loaded successfully without crash
- Analysis: Single corrupted slice in middle of series was handled gracefully

**Important Insight**: The viewer appears **robust to isolated slice corruption** when loading complete 3D series, but may hang when opening individual corrupted files directly.

### 3. Mutation Effectiveness

**Successful Injection Payloads**:

```python
# SQL Injection in numeric fields
"Samples per Pixel": "' OR '1'='1"

# XSS in metadata
"Bits Stored": "<script>alert('xss')</script>"
"Largest Image Pixel Value": "Study<script>alert(1)</script>"

# Invalid UIDs
"High Bit": "1.2.392.200036.9116"  # UID in integer field

# Type confusion
"Largest Image Pixel Value": "US"  # VR type as value
```

**Mutation Challenges** (write failures):

- 8/10 fuzzed files too corrupted for pydicom to serialize
- This is expected: extreme mutations break file format itself
- Indicates mutations are aggressive enough to break parsers

### 4. Hang Detection (Potential DoS)

**Files Causing Hangs**:

- `fuzzed_moderate_dcm171037358.0000_*.dcm` (514 KB)
- `fuzzed_moderate_dcm171037358.0005_*.dcm` (514 KB)

Both files are significantly larger than other fuzzed files (1.4-1.8 KB), suggesting:

- Source slices contained full pixel data (512x512 CT images)
- Mutations corrupted metadata but preserved pixel data size
- Viewer may hang when processing corrupted metadata on large pixel arrays

**Hypothesis**: Hang caused by:

- Infinite loop parsing corrupted large pixel data
- Memory allocation failure on invalid dimensions
- Decompression failure with malformed transfer syntax

---

## Current State vs. Desired State

### What Works Today

✅ **2D Single-File Fuzzing**:

- Load individual DICOM files
- Apply grammar-aware mutations
- Detect crashes and hangs
- Generate detailed reports

✅ **Mutation Intelligence**:

- Dictionary-based attacks (SQL, XSS, path traversal)
- Type confusion (wrong VR types)
- Boundary values (0, -1, MAX_INT, NULL)
- Invalid encodings

✅ **Crash Analysis**:

- Crash detection (exit code, timeout)
- Deduplication (group similar crashes)
- Mutation tracking (know which mutation caused crash)
- Artifact preservation (fuzzed files, logs)

### What's Missing for 3D

❌ **Series Awareness**:

- No grouping by `SeriesInstanceUID`
- No understanding of slice relationships
- Cannot mutate series-level metadata

❌ **Coordinated Mutations**:

- Cannot inject inconsistencies across slices
- No gradient attacks (progressive corruption)
- No boundary attacks (first/middle/last slice)

❌ **3D Viewer Testing**:

- Opens individual files, not folders
- Misses 3D reconstruction bugs
- Cannot test volume rendering crashes

## Roadmap Created

Comprehensive **5-phase plan** documented in [3D_FUZZING_ROADMAP.md](./3D_FUZZING_ROADMAP.md):

### Phase 1: Series Detection & Validation (2-3 weeks)

- Group DICOM files by `SeriesInstanceUID`
- Validate series completeness (missing slices, spacing)
- Create `DicomSeries` data structure

### Phase 2: Series-Level Mutations (3-4 weeks)

- Implement 5 mutation strategies:
  1. Series metadata corruption
  2. Slice position attacks
  3. Boundary slice targeting
  4. Gradient mutations
  5. Inconsistency injection

### Phase 3: Viewer Integration (2-3 weeks)

- Folder-based viewer launching
- 3D crash detection (rendering, MPR)
- Resource monitoring (memory during 3D load)

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization (2 weeks)

- Handle 500+ slice series efficiently
- Parallel mutation processing
- Lazy loading and caching

### Phase 5: Enhanced Reporting (2 weeks)

- Series-level crash reports
- 3D visualization of corrupted geometry
- Automatic minimization (binary search)

**Total Timeline**: 11-15 weeks (3-4 months)

## Security & Privacy Considerations

### Public Repository Guidelines

Since this is a **public GitHub repository**, the following rules apply:

✅ **Safe to Include**:

- Generic architecture and design patterns
- Public DICOM test datasets (NEMA, TCIA)
- Configurable paths (environment variables)
- Generic viewer examples (not vendor-specific)

❌ **Never Include**:

- Proprietary DICOM datasets
- Patient data (PHI/PII)
- Hardcoded paths to internal systems
- Vendor-specific exploit code
- Internal application names/details

### Ethical Use Statement

## Lessons Learned

### 1. 3D vs 2D DICOM Storage

**Key Insight**: Most medical imaging uses **multi-slice series** (separate files per slice), not multi-frame DICOM (single file with many frames).

This means:

- 3D fuzzing requires **folder-level operations**, not just file-level
- Series relationships defined by DICOM metadata (`SeriesInstanceUID`)
- Slice order critical: `InstanceNumber`, `ImagePositionPatient`, `SliceLocation`

### 2. Viewer Robustness Varies by Context

**Observation**: Same viewer behaved differently with:

- Individual corrupted file → Hang/DoS
- Corrupted file within complete series → Graceful handling

This suggests:

- Isolated file loading has different code path than series loading
- 3D reconstruction may have better error handling
- Single-file vulnerabilities != series vulnerabilities (need to test both)

### 3. Mutation Severity Trade-offs

**Finding**: Aggressive mutations (MODERATE severity) caused:

- 80% write failures (too corrupted to serialize)
- 100% hang rate on successfully written files

**Implication**:

- Need mutation severity tuning for 3D series
- May want "coordinated moderate" rather than "isolated aggressive"
- Balance: findable crashes vs. valid DICOM structure

### 4. Command-Line Integration Essential

**Discovery**: Viewers support folder arguments via CLI:

```bash
viewer.exe "path/to/series/folder"
```

This enables:

- Automated 3D testing (no GUI interaction)
- Scripted fuzzing campaigns
- CI/CD integration
- Reproducible tests

### 5. Privacy-First Architecture Required

**Constraint**: Public repository + medical data = strict guidelines needed

**Solution**:

- Configuration-based paths (no hardcoding)
- Public dataset examples only
- Clear ethical use statements
- De-identification utilities (future)

## Questions for Future Investigation

1. **What caused the hang in individual files?**
   - Need to analyze mutation details from session JSON
   - Correlate with specific DICOM tags modified
   - Reproduce in debugger for root cause

2. **Why did series-level loading succeed?**
   - Different error handling in batch loading?
   - Viewer skips corrupted slices automatically?
   - Need instrumentation to see viewer behavior

3. **What's the optimal mutation strategy for 3D?**
   - Single aggressive slice vs. multiple moderate slices?
   - Random position vs. strategic position (first/last)?
   - Need experimentation and metrics

4. **How to detect 3D-specific crashes?**
   - Volume rendering failures
   - MPR (multi-planar reformation) bugs
   - Memory exhaustion on large series
   - Need viewer-specific instrumentation
