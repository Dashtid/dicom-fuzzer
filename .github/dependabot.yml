  # Enable version updates for Python dependencies
  # Note: This uses pip ecosystem as dependabot doesn't yet fully support uv.lock
  # Dependencies are managed through pyproject.toml [dependency-groups] and uv.lock
  # Dependabot will create PRs based on pyproject.toml, then we regenerate uv.lock
