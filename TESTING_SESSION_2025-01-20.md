# Testing Session Summary - January 20, 2025

## Session Overview

**Date**: 2025-01-20
**Duration**: ~1 hour
**Focus**: Test coverage improvements for core modules
**Final Coverage**: 24.22% overall (CORRECTED - was reporting per-module coverage incorrectly)

## Achievements

### Test Coverage Improvements

This session systematically improved test coverage across 4 core modules through creating comprehensive additional test files targeting uncovered code paths.

#### Coverage Progress by Module

| Module           | Initial Coverage | Final Coverage | Improvement | Test File                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| **validator.py** | 16.67%           | 91.33%         | +74.66%     | test_validator_additional.py |
| **parser.py**    | 20.41%           | 58.50%         | +38.09%     | test_parser_additional.py    |
| **generator.py** | 76.67%           | 100.00%        | +23.33%     | test_generator_additional.py |
| **mutator.py**   | 30.26%           | 88.16%         | +57.90%     | test_mutator_additional.py   |

**Total Statements Covered**: 836 additional statements across 4 modules

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: During the session, I was incorrectly running coverage reports with `--cov=dicom_fuzzer.core.MODULE` which only measured coverage of individual modules. The actual **overall project coverage is 24.22%**, not 14.51%. The individual module improvements listed above are correct, but the overall percentage was measured incorrectly during the session.

### Test Files Created

#### 1. test_validator_additional.py (331 lines, 27 tests)

**Coverage**: 16.67% → 91.33%

**Test Coverage Areas**:

- Security validation (null bytes, oversized tags, invalid VRs)
- Batch validation with early stopping
- Required tag enforcement (PatientName, StudyDate)
- DICOM compliance checks (transfer syntax, file meta)
- Edge cases (empty datasets, minimal files, missing FileMetaDataset)
- Error handling for corrupted/malformed files

**Key Approach**:

- Replaced mock-based tests with real DICOM files using `pydicom.dcmwrite()`
- Used `tmp_path` fixtures for filesystem-based testing
- Targeted specific uncovered lines from coverage reports
- Focused on error handling paths and security checks

#### 2. test_parser_additional.py (396 lines, 27 tests)

**Coverage**: 20.41% → 58.50%

**Test Coverage Areas**:

- Metadata extraction (patient info, study info, series info)
- Private tag handling and validation
- Tag operations (iteration, lookup, nested sequences)
- Pixel data retrieval (with/without data)
- Large dataset handling (100+ tags)
- Deeply nested sequences (3+ levels)
- Missing FileMetaDataset scenarios

**Key Fixes**:

- Fixed API mismatch: `get_metadata()` → `extract_metadata()`
- Changed assertions to use `in` operator for string matching (metadata includes DICOM tag descriptions)
- Built nested sequences from innermost to outermost to avoid recursion errors

#### 3. test_generator_additional.py (350 lines, 26 tests)

**Coverage**: 76.67% → 100% ✅

**Test Coverage Areas**:

- Mutation error handling (skip vs. raise modes)
- Statistics tracking and verification
- All mutation strategies (metadata, header, pixel, structure, dictionary)
- Batch generation with varying parameters
- Output directory creation and management
- Edge cases (missing source file, invalid paths)

**Achievement**: First module to reach 100% coverage in this session!

#### 4. test_mutator_additional.py (425 lines, 27 tests)

**Coverage**: 30.26% → 88.16%

**Test Coverage Areas**:

- MutationRecord and MutationSession dataclasses
- Configuration management (custom config, defaults)
- Strategy registration and validation
- Session management (start/end/summary)
- Mutation application (num_mutations, severity, specific strategies)
- Error handling in mutation application
- Safety checks and strategy filtering
- Edge cases (empty datasets, zero mutations, multiple sessions)

**Key API Corrections**:

- MutationSeverity enum values: MINIMAL, MODERATE, AGGRESSIVE, EXTREME (not HIGH/LOW)
- Strategy API: `get_strategy_name()` method (not `.name` attribute)
- `end_session()` returns `MutationSession` object (not dict)
- `get_session_summary()` returns dict or None
- `start_session(dataset)` requires dataset parameter

## Technical Approach

### Testing Philosophy

**Real DICOM Files Over Mocks**: Shifted from mock-based testing to creating real DICOM files using `pydicom.dcmwrite()` for more accurate testing.

**Example Pattern**:

```python
def test_feature(self, tmp_path):
    """Test specific feature with real DICOM file."""
    test_file = tmp_path / "test.dcm"

    # Create real DICOM file
    file_meta = FileMetaDataset()
    file_meta.TransferSyntaxUID = "1.2.840.10008.1.2"

    ds = Dataset()
    ds.file_meta = file_meta
    ds.PatientName = "Test^Patient"

    pydicom.dcmwrite(str(test_file), ds)

    # Test with real file
    result = function_under_test(test_file)
    assert expected_behavior
```

### Coverage Analysis Process

1. **Identify Uncovered Lines**: Run pytest with `--cov-report=term-missing`
2. **Read Source Code**: Understand what each uncovered line does
3. **Create Targeted Tests**: Write tests that exercise uncovered paths
4. **Verify Coverage**: Re-run with coverage to confirm improvement
5. **Commit and Push**: Document improvements in commit message

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue                                 | Solution                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Mock objects not iterable             | Use real DICOM files instead of mocks           |
| API method name mismatches            | Read source code to verify correct method names |
| Assertion failures on string matching | Use `in` operator for partial matches           |
| RecursionError in nested sequences    | Build sequences from innermost outward          |
| Missing closing parentheses in Mock() | Careful sed usage, manual verification          |

```

## Key Learnings

### What Worked Well

1. **Real DICOM files** significantly more reliable than mocks
2. **Systematic approach**: Read source → identify gaps → create tests → verify
3. **tmp_path fixtures** excellent for filesystem-based testing
4. **Coverage reports** with `--cov-report=term-missing` invaluable for targeting gaps
5. **Incremental commits** after each module helped track progress

### Challenges Encountered

1. **API discovery**: Required reading source code to find correct method names
2. **Mock limitations**: Mock objects failed for complex interactions
3. **String matching**: DICOM metadata includes tag descriptions, needed partial matching
4. **Regex replacements**: sed commands sometimes created syntax errors (missing parens)

### Best Practices Established

1. Always read source code before writing tests
2. Use real objects instead of mocks when possible
3. Verify coverage improvements immediately after writing tests
4. Commit after each module to preserve progress
5. Document API quirks in test comments

## Quick Start for Next Session

### Resume Testing Work

```bash
# Activate environment
cd /path/to/dicom-fuzzer
.venv/Scripts/activate

# Check current coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=dicom_fuzzer --cov-report=term-missing | tail -50

# Pick next module to test (suggestion: parser.py or crash_analyzer.py)
pytest tests/ --cov=dicom_fuzzer.core.parser --cov-report=term-missing

# Create new test file
# Follow pattern from test_*_additional.py files
```

### Coverage Goals

**To reach 15% (need +0.49%)**:

- Approximately 28 more statements needed
